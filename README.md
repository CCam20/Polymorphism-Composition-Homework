---

## What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example.
* Assigning a difrent class to another class while keeping the original 

---

## What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?
* Interfaces

---

## How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?
* As many as required

---

## Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.
* Using the theme park model and making the assumption that all rides, attractions and food stalls have the ability to be reviewed, using an interface 'IReview' allows us to apply the IReview class to very other class regardless of there default class or inherited class may be

---

## What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?
* A class using objects from another class

---

## When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.
* A car class that uses classes like engine, types, gearbox etc

---

## Give a difference between composition and aggregation?
* In composition the child objects/classes cannot exist without the parent class<br>
* In aggregation the child objects can exist independently 

---

## What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition/aggregation?
* Reuse of code, 
* More flexable than inhearatence, 
* Less chance of conflict with method names 

---

## When using composition, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
* They are also destroyed

---

## When using aggregation, when an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?
* They remain
